<h3>The Rhyme of the Loch</h3>

<p>
    Haikus are not known to rhyme all the time, <br>
    So here we have waterfowl instead. <br>
    Cranes don't drive cranes nor trains nor planes,<br>
    But they swim among koi, white and red.<br>
    <br>
    Today, the ducks have so much luck,<br>
    but please don't be superstitious (phew!).<br>
    I mean, the lake is so clean, take a break!<br>
    But do the ducks really know who's who?<br>
</p>




<h3>When Sloths Smile Back, and So Should You</h3>

<p>
    I have always liked that sloths (the animal) always smile. I think they are a <br>
    beautiful to always keep a positive outlook in life. <br><br>

    However, real sloths are not necessarily known to DuckType. <br>
